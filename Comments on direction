Add the following use cases:
1. Authentication.
2. Tag walks.
3. Join a walk.
4. Event/communication platform for multiple users to decide on a checkpoint.
5. Locate all members during a group walk

Other comments:
1. The use case for saving data should be described as creating a walk.
2. Upload pictures, rating a walk, posting a walk should each be in separate use cases. 
(No points deducted for both).

 Also look at the use case list uploaded for other possible cases.
